(** {1 Catala operator utilities} *)

(** Resolving operators from the surface syntax proceeds in three steps:

    - During desugaring, the operators may remain untyped (with [TAny]) or, if
      they have an explicit type suffix (e.g. the [$] for "money" in [+$]),
      their operands types are already explicited in the [EOp] expression node.
    - {!modules:Shared_ast.Typing} will then enforce these constraints in
      addition to the known built-in type for each operator (e.g.
      [Eq: 'a -> 'a -> 'a] isn't encoded in the first-order AST types).
    - Finally, during {!modules:Scopelang.From_desugared}, these types are
      leveraged to resolve the overloaded operators to their concrete,
      monomorphic counterparts

val overload_type :

(** The type for typing overloads is different since the types of the operands
    are required in advance.

(** Polymorphic operators are typed directly within [Typing], since their types
    may contain type variables that can't be expressed outside of it*)

val resolve_overload :
  decl_ctx ->
  (desugared, overloaded) t Marked.pos ->
  typ list ->
  ([< scopelang | dcalc | lcalc ], resolved) t * [ `Straight | `Reversed ]
(** Some overloads are sugar for an operation with reversed operands, e.g.
    [TRat * TMoney] is using [mult_mon_rat]. [`Reversed] is returned to signify
    this case. *)
