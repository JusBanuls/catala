For example: There is $1000 debt cancelled. In general, this would be in gross income.
It’s not in gross income if you’re insolvent. HOWEVER, only to the extent you’re insolvent.

- If your liabilities are $10,000 and your assets are $6,000 - it’s all excluded.
- If your liabilities are $10,000 and your assets are $9,700 - only $300 is excluded.

```catala
scope Test1:
  definition taxpayer.fmv_assets equals $6000
  definition taxpayer.liabilities equals $10,000
  definition taxpayer.discharge_of_indebtedness equals $1,000

  definition return.taxpayer equals taxpayer
  definition line11.return equals return

  assertion return.gross_income11 = $0
```
